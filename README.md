# macos-defaults

This repository is intended to serve as a comprehensive library for the macOS
`defaults` tool and general knowledge base for programmatically altering
system and application settings. It is heavily inspired by and aims to be an
extension of projects such as [macOS-Defaults](https://github.com/kevinSuttle/macOS-Defaults)
and [macos-defaults](https://github.com/yannbertrand/macos-defaults).

Where possible, we aim to organize commands and scripts in a way that mimics
the structure of existing preference panes. This makes it easy to find and
adopt automation for known settings. For preferences not exposed by
preference panes or other common UIs, we try to group commands by app or
`defaults` domain.
